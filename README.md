### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Human-Centered Computer Systems Lab](https://hcs.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/).
My research interests lie in enhancing XR systems with deep learning.
Recently, I have been looking at scene understanding techniques based on deep learning.
